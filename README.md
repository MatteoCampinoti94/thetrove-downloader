This Python package allows to easily download any resource, be it folder or file,
from [The Trove.is](https://thetrove.is).

## Installation and Requirements

The program requires Python 3.9 or above.

To install the program it is sufficient to use Python pip and get the package `thetrove-downloader`. The package will
add a new command `thetrove-downloader`.

```shell
python3 -m pip install thetrove-downloader
```

Updates should be performed via pip.

```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade thetrove-downloader
```

## Usage

```shell
thetrove-downloader [-h] [-t, --target TARGET] [--target-url URL]
                    [-j, --json JSON] [-f, --folder FOLDER]
                    [-o, --output OUTPUT] [-b, --blacklist BLACKLIST]
                    [-w, --whitelist WHITELIST] [--no-download]
                    [--no-preserve-root]
```

* `-h, --help` show help message

* `-t, --target <TARGET>` download target (folder or file)<br>
  To download a specific resource, start the program with the `--target` command and supply a valid path (e.g., "
  Books/White Star").

* `--target-url` download target (full URL to folder or file)<br>
  Overrides `--target` argument with a full URL and sets the download target to the path of the URL (
  e.g., "https://thetrove.is/Open%20Source/BIND%20RPG" to "Open Source/BIND RPG").

* `-j, --json <JSON>` save/read instructions from a JSON file<br>
  The `--json` option allows to specify a file to save the target, folder, output, whitelist, and blacklist instructions
  in JSON format. Launching the program with only the `--json` option will load the instructions previously saved in the
  file and perform all of them in succession. This can be used to keep a local copy of specific resources up to date.

* `-f, --folder <FOLDER>` destination folder<br>
  The `--folder` option allows to specify a folder in which the targeted resource will be downloaded.

* `-o, --output <OUTPUT>` output name of download target<br>
  The `--output` option allows to override the folder/file name of the resource. Note that if the targeted resource is a
  folder, the option will only apply to the top-level folder and leave all contents therein unaltered.

* `-b, --blacklist <BLACKLIST>` regex blacklist for files/folders<br>
  The `--whitelist` option allows to specify a regex pattern that will be used to skip files and folder that do not
  contain the supplied pattern. Overwrites blacklist options.

* `-w, --whitelist <WHITELIST>` regex whitelist for files/folders, overrides blacklist<br>
  The `--whitelist` option allows to specify a regex pattern that will be used to skip files and folder that do not
  contain the supplied pattern. Overwrites blacklist options.

* `--no-download` list content without downloading<br>
  The `--no-download` flag allows to list the content under the supplied target without performing any download. The
  instructions will still be saved in a JSON file if the `--json` options is used, but not the flag.

* `--no-preserve-root` allows the download of root folders<br>
  The `--no-preserve-root` flag allows downloading entire root folders such as "/Books/". This flag is not preserved
  with the `--json` option and must be passed manually every time.

_**NOTE**_: the program requires to use either `--target`, `--json`, or both `--target` and `--json`. Without one of
these combinations the program won't have a valid download instruction.

## Notes on Crawling

The program performs all GET requests without throttling or delay and with no disallowed paths as per the instructions
at [thetrove.is/robots.txt](https://thetrove.is/robots.txt).

However, please do take care to not overuse this utility and risk overwhelming their connection. Thank you.

Root folders such as "/Books" are protected and cannot be downloaded without using the `--no-preserve-root` flag.
